  <h1> "The Melancholic Memoirs of Chioma Nnadi"</h1> 
  <p> I'm a generally unintersting person with a typical lifestyle.</p>
  <p> In my free time, I either daydream, sketch, research random things, or watch stuff. </p>
  <p> My favorite things to watch vary widely. Among my favorite TV shows are Snapped, Hunter x Hunter (both 1999 and 2011), Cops, See No Evil/Hear No Evil on ID, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and Star vs. the Forces of Evil. Some shows I hate, on the other hand, are, in order from most hated to least hated, are Yuri on Ice, any papparazzi shows, Beserk 2016, and any talk shows.</p>
  <p> I watch a lot of anime, including but not limited to Shrek, Lazy Town, Spongebob, and the classic Cory in the House. </p>
  <p> My favorite movie is The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. That movie also happens to be the second longest movie in animation.</p>
  <p> An imporrtant fact about me is that I'm not a good speaker. I can also be a cynic sometimes. </p>
  <p> I happen to very much dislike pretentious people, especially when the person doesn't realize they're pretentious. I also dislike grammatically incorrect sentences."
  <p> I don't have any pictures of myself to show.</p>

  <h3> Reflection</h3>
  1. It's mostly a read-only, so anyone except the blind could read it. In those cases, it would be possible to use a text to speech software.2. Everyone else was using pictures and fancy fonts. They did this by learning how to emb imags and video into their html, and also knew to change the fonts. 3. I'm most roud of erning how to make text appear on a website. It was really hard to get started, but now is fairly simple to me.</p>
  
  <h1> Core4 </h1>
  <p> Variables are the things thst sotre values. Functions are the things that store blocks of cde. Loops are things that repeat specific lines of code until a certain requirement is met. Conditionals are self explanatory. They set a condition and perform an action based on said condition. Those are the Core4. They are the basics of all programming languages, similar to how the core of all spoken language comes down to reading writing, listening, and speaking.</p>

  <h1> Obamicon</h1>
  <p> Today I Obamicon'ed a picture of  Shrek. It was rather complicated. I had to define a bunch of images and set a bunch of conditions. Basically, I did one little thing that my computer didn't like, and it went haywire with error messages. All that stress basically took away from the joy of Obamicon'ing a mematic picture. I technically would upload the finished product, but it's not saving to the computer.</p>

  <p>That's what I edited, though. I'll probably come back when I'm less busy to try saving the finished product so I can upload it.</p>
  <p> I wasn't really sure what to expect with the project. I kinda just followed along. But I feel this could be useful for editing photos and pictures in the future later on.</p>

  <h2>This Week in Robotics</h2>
  <p>From Monday to Thursday, we were programming robots and Arduino circuit boards. I found it really frustrating, but ever so satisfying when the thing did stuff. That's just how I am with technology. So, we started off making the LED on the robot turn on, and then blink, and then move and blink, and then play music, and  then play music as it moves and blinks the LED. We used a website called Tinkercad to sort of draft out the circuits, although the issue there was that using Tinkercad was even more confusing than just experimenting directly on the robot. So I guess I'm not using Tinkercad much anymore. In the end though, we got it working. Because of how the music sounded and the work it took to debug it, we called the robot "Depressed Mario." That was that, I suppose.</p>
  <h2>Today Trip</h2>
  <p>Today we took a trip to Gibson Dunn Law Firm. I believe it is worth mentioning first that this was the first time I had ever taken an elevator forty stories- specifically, 47 stories, but lets not get into the nitty gritty details. I really like Mike Chung's presentation. He's in the Pentagon, from what I picked up. There was also Abbey and Nina, who were these two lawyer ladies that participated in a huge legal battle over the California gay marraige ban and the Muslim immigration restriction quotas. I liked their enthusiasm and dedication, it made the presentations much more interesting. We may or may not be able to go on a trip to the Pentagon sometime over the summer. I hope we do. </p>
