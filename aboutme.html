  <h1> "The Melancholic Memoirs of Chioma Nnadi"</h1> 
  <p> I'm a generally unintersting person with a typical lifestyle.</p>
  <p> In my free time, I either daydream, sketch, research random things, or watch stuff. </p>
  <p> My favorite things to watch vary widely. Among my favorite TV shows are Snapped, Hunter x Hunter, Cops, See No Evil/Hear No Evil on ID, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and Star vs. the Forces of Evil.</p>
  <p> I watch a lot of anime, including but not limited to Shrek, Lazy Town, Spongebob, and the classic Cory in the House. </p>
  <p> My favorite movie is The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. That movie also happens to be the second longest movie in animation.</p>
  <p> An imporrtant fact about me is that I'm not a good speaker. I can also be a cynic sometimes. </p>
